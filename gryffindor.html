      <h2>History</h2>
  <img src="images/godric-gryffindor.jpg" alt="Godric Gryffindor" style="float: right; width: 200px; margin: 0 0 15px 15px; border-radius: 8px;" />
      <p><strong>Founder:</strong> Godric Gryffindor, one of the four founders of Hogwarts, lived over a thousand years ago during the medieval period.</p>
      
      <p>Godric Gryffindor was known as one of the greatest wizards of his time. He came from a wild moor in the west of England and was renowned for his skill in dueling and his progressive views on magical education. Unlike some of his fellow founders, Gryffindor believed that any child showing magical ability should be allowed to attend Hogwarts, regardless of their background.</p>
      
      <p>The Sorting Hat, which determines which house each student belongs to, once belonged to Godric Gryffindor himself. Before his death, all four founders enchanted the hat to continue sorting students according to their values and the founders' wishes.</p>
      
      <p><strong>The Sword of Gryffindor:</strong> One of the most famous artifacts associated with the house is the Sword of Gryffindor, a goblin-made blade that presents itself to any worthy Gryffindor in their time of need. The sword is embedded with rubies and has the ability to absorb substances that make it stronger, such as basilisk venom.</p>
      
      <p>Throughout history, Gryffindor has been home to many of the most celebrated heroes in the wizarding world, including numerous members of the Order of the Phoenix and those who stood against dark forces throughout the ages.</p>
