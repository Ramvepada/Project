      <h2>History</h2>
  <img src="images/salazar-slytherin.jpg" alt="Salazar Slytherin" style="float: right; width: 200px; margin: 0 0 15px 15px; border-radius: 8px;" />
      <p><strong>Founder:</strong> Salazar Slytherin, one of the four founders of Hogwarts, who lived over a thousand years ago.</p>
      
      <p>Salazar Slytherin was one of the most accomplished wizards of his age. He came from the fen and was particularly famous for his ability to speak Parseltongue, the language of serpents. This rare gift has been passed down through his descendants, though it has become increasingly uncommon.</p>
      
      <p>Slytherin had strong views about magical education. He believed that Hogwarts should only teach pure-blood students, as he distrusted Muggle-born wizards and witches. This disagreement with the other founders, particularly Godric Gryffindor, eventually led to Slytherin's departure from the school. Before leaving, he constructed the Chamber of Secrets, a hidden chamber within Hogwarts.</p>
      
      <p><strong>The Chamber of Secrets:</strong> This legendary chamber was said to house a monster that only Slytherin's heir could control. The chamber remained hidden for centuries until it was opened by Tom Riddle (Lord Voldemort) in the 1940s and again in 1992.</p>
      
      <p>Despite its controversial founder, Slytherin House has produced many accomplished witches and wizards who have made significant contributions to the wizarding world. Not all Slytherins follow dark paths; many use their ambition and cunning for positive purposes, becoming successful in various fields such as politics, business, and magical research.</p>
      
      <p>After the Second Wizarding War, the house began to shed some of its darker reputation, with a renewed focus on the positive aspects of ambition and resourcefulness.</p>
