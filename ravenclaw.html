      <h2>History</h2>
  <img src="images/rowena-ravenclaw.jpg" alt="Rowena Ravenclaw" />
      <p><strong>Founder:</strong> Rowena Ravenclaw, one of the four founders of Hogwarts, renowned as the most brilliant witch of her time.</p>
      
      <p>Rowena Ravenclaw was celebrated for her intelligence and creativity. She came from glen and was particularly famous for her innovative ideas about magical education. It was her idea to have moving staircases at Hogwarts, demonstrating her inventive nature.</p>
      
      <p>Ravenclaw believed that the pursuit of knowledge was the noblest quest. She valued wit and learning above all else, and these principles have guided her house for over a millennium. Her house has produced some of the most brilliant minds in wizarding history, including countless inventors, innovators, and scholars.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem:</strong> One of her most famous creations was an enchanted diadem that was said to enhance the wisdom of the wearer. The diadem bore the inscription: "Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure." Tragically, the diadem was stolen by her daughter Helena and later became one of Voldemort's Horcruxes.</p>
      
      <p>The relationship between Rowena and her daughter Helena ended in tragedy. Helena stole the diadem out of jealousy and fled to Albania. Rowena, heartbroken and ill, sent the Bloody Baron to retrieve her daughter. When Helena refused to return, the Baron killed her in a rage and then killed himself in remorse. Both became ghosts at Hogwarts—Helena as the Grey Lady of Ravenclaw, and the Baron as Slytherin's ghost.</p>
      
      <p>Throughout the centuries, Ravenclaw Tower has been home to students who have pushed the boundaries of magical knowledge, creating new spells, discovering magical properties, and advancing the understanding of magic itself.</p>
