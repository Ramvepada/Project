      <h2>History</h2>
  <img src="images/helga-hufflepuff.jpg" alt="Helga Hufflepuff" style="float: right; width: 200px; margin: 0 0 15px 15px; border-radius: 8px;" />
      <p><strong>Founder:</strong> Helga Hufflepuff, one of the four founders of Hogwarts, was known for her fairness and acceptance of all students.</p>
      
      <p>Helga Hufflepuff was one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She came from valley and was renowned for her exceptional skills in food-related charms. In fact, many of the recipes used in the Hogwarts kitchens today originate from Hufflepuff herself.</p>
      
      <p>While the other founders chose students based on specific traits, Hufflepuff believed in giving everyone a chance. She declared: "I'll teach the lot and treat them just the same." This inclusive philosophy meant that Hufflepuff accepted students who might not fit the specific criteria of other houses, but who possessed their own unique strengths and qualities.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Helga Hufflepuff's Cup:</strong> One of her most prized possessions was a golden cup with two handles, which she enchanted. The cup was passed down through generations before eventually being stolen by Tom Riddle (Voldemort) and turned into one of his Horcruxes. It was destroyed by Hermione Granger during the Battle of Hogwarts.</p>
      
      <p>Hufflepuff was particularly close friends with Rowena Ravenclaw. When disagreements arose between Salazar Slytherin and the other founders, Hufflepuff sided with Gryffindor and Ravenclaw, believing that all magical children deserved education regardless of their blood status.</p>
      
      <p><strong>House Achievements:</strong> Despite being often underestimated, Hufflepuff has an impressive record at Hogwarts. The house has produced the fewest Dark wizards of all four houses—a testament to the values of loyalty and fair play instilled by Helga Hufflepuff. During the Battle of Hogwarts, Hufflepuff had the second-largest number of students stay to fight, just after Gryffindor.</p>
      
      <p>The house emblem is a badger, chosen because badgers are often underestimated but are fierce fighters when protecting their own—much like Hufflepuffs themselves.</p>
